Make sure you have python 3. We ran our program on Python 3.8 (64-bit) for Windows.

Have a text editor (atom, viscose, notepad++, whatever).

Have git installed or some graphical git application so you can interact with the repo. Look up tutorials on how to use it. For the most part, you just need to pull from what's there so you can use it.

You need to install the Python libraries that are used by the GUI.py file. You need a c++ compiler installed as well before you can install dlib, such as the one that comes with Visual Studio. Copy and paste this into your command line to get the libraries:

pip install opencv-python
pip install pillow
pip install datetime
pip install argparse
pip install imutils
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pyserial
pip install scipy
pip install sounddevice
pip install cmake
pip install dlib
